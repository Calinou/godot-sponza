## Try it out

### Installation

Clone the Git repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/Calinou/godot-sponza.git
```

You can also
[download a ZIP archive](https://github.com/Calinou/godot-sponza/archive/master.zip)
if you do not have Git installed.

**You need [Godot 3.0 beta 1](https://godotengine.org/article/dev-snapshot-godot-3-0-beta-1) (or newer) to run this demo.**

Once you have the project files, open the Godot Project Manager, click the
**Import** button, then select the `project.godot` file of this project.
Confirm importing, then edit the project (so that the resources are imported
by the editor). Exit the editor (go back to the project manager), then run
the project. This is to make sure the editor does not render the demo in
the background, which would slow down the running project a lot.
